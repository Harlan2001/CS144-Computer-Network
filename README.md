# CS144 : Computer Networks

One of the keynote speakers in this course is Professor Nick McKeown, a giant in the field of networking.The academic mogul, who owns his own startup, ends each chapter of his MOOC with an interview with an industry executive or academic guru, which is very eye-opening.

In the Project of this course, you will use C++ to build the whole TCP/IP protocol stack step by step, realize IP routing and ARP protocol, and finally use your own protocol stack instead of the Linux Kernel network protocol stack to communicate with other students' computers.It's amazing!
